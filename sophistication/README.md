- Structures! Build them and advance them, while advancing your score! Be careful, because they'll decay over time if you allow them and lose you the game.
- Trade! A good trade network will advance your empire by itself, as long as it's maintained.
- God Mode (for advanced players).
- Pirates! They can decay your empire quite quickly. Be wary!
